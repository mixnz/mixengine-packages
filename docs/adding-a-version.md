# Adding a version

*Part of [mixengine-packages](../README.md), which holds the table of what is packaged.*

```bash
# Windows: borrow, repack, verify, smoke-test — runs anywhere Python 3 does
python tools/php_windows.py --version 8.3.33 --out dist/

# macOS / Linux, 8.1 and newer: static-php-cli builds it
python3 tools/php_unix.py --branch 8.3 --out dist/

# macOS / Linux, 7.0 – 8.0: compiled from source, then made to carry its own libraries
python3 tools/php_legacy_unix.py --branch 7.4 --out dist/

# Node.js: one recipe for every target, run on the target it packs for
python tools/node.py --version 22 --out dist/

# Python: likewise, from python-build-standalone's newest release unless one is pinned
python tools/python.py --version 3.12 --out dist/

# Ruby: Windows borrows RubyInstaller's archive
python tools/ruby.py --version 3.4 --out dist/

# Ruby on macOS / Linux: compiled, with its own OpenSSL and its own CA bundle
python3 tools/ruby_unix.py --version 3.4 --out dist/

# Caddy: one recipe for every target, and it runs the server it packed before publishing it
python tools/caddy.py --version 2 --out dist/

# MariaDB: three recipes, chosen by what upstream publishes for the cell being packed
python tools/mariadb.py --version 11.8 --out dist/        # Windows x86_64, Linux x86_64
python3 tools/mariadb_deb.py --version 11.8 --out dist/   # Linux aarch64, out of upstream's .deb
python tools/mariadb_build.py --version 11.8 --out dist/  # macOS, and Windows on ARM64

# MySQL: two recipes, and which cell uses which depends on the version. 8.0 and newer are
# upstream's tarballs; 5.6 and 5.7 are compiled on all four Unix cells, because Oracle withdrew
# macOS from both lines while they were alive and never published an ARM build of either
python tools/mysql_borrow.py --version 9.7.1 --out dist/
python3 tools/mysql_build.py --version 5.6.51 --out dist/
python tools/mysql.py --version all --plan   # which line resolves to which version, and why

# PostgreSQL: two recipes, because the project publishes no binaries of its own
python tools/postgres.py --version 18 --out dist/         # EDB's, most of which is never unpacked
python3 tools/postgres_deb.py --version 18 --out dist/    # Linux, out of the project's own .deb

# Redis and Memcached: compiled everywhere, because neither project publishes a binary anywhere —
# and refusing to run on Windows, because neither has a Windows build to compile
python3 tools/redis.py --version 8 --out dist/
python3 tools/memcached.py --version 1.6 --out dist/

# nginx: one recipe that borrows on Windows and compiles on Unix, against the configure line it
# reads off the borrowed binary. Needs a gpg — nginx signs its releases and hashes none of them
python tools/nginx.py --version 1.30 --out dist/

# Then regenerate and sign the index from what the releases actually contain
python tools/mkindex.py --base-url … --out dist/index.json
minisign -Sm dist/index.json -s "$MINISIGN_KEY"   # the key is not in this tree; see the-archive.md

# And, when a publisher moves a support schedule, transcribe it again rather than editing a date
python tools/eol.py            # compare every written date against its publisher
python tools/eol.py --update   # rewrite them from it, and commit the diff

# Ask whether the archive the published index promises is still there
python tools/permanence.py               # HEAD every asset, hash this week's eighth of them
python tools/permanence.py --slices 1    # hash all of it, which is a six-gigabyte download
```

In practice none of that is run by hand: `.github/workflows/build-php.yml` takes a version, picks the
recipe from it and produces every target; `build-node.yml`, `build-python.yml`, `build-caddy.yml`,
`build-redis.yml`, `build-memcached.yml` and `build-nginx.yml` do the same with one recipe and six;
`build-ruby.yml` runs six legs across two recipes; and `publish-index.yml` regenerates and signs the
index from every release that exists. Two run on a clock rather than on a request — `check-eol.yml`
and `check-archive.yml` — and [dates](end-of-life-dates.md) and [the archive](the-archive.md) are
why: both watch something that can go wrong while nothing in this repository is touched.

Dispatching those by hand has two ways to go quietly wrong — `release` and `publish` both default to
off, and the version input is called `branch` on one workflow, `versions` on two and `version` on the
rest — so [`release/`](../release/README.md) wraps them. `release/build.sh <kind> <version>` and then
`release/publish.sh`, which is the whole of what a new patch needs.

MySQL's Windows-on-ARM64 cell is the one empty cell here with **no leg at all**, which is a departure
from the practice below worth naming where it can be found: Redis, memcached and nginx keep an empty
leg because what they publish for that cell can change with a version, and Oracle has never published
an ARM64 Windows MySQL at any version of any line. `tools/mysql.py`'s runner table simply has no row
for it, and the workflow says so at the top rather than spending a runner minute on it every run.

Three of those keep legs in the matrix that produce nothing by design — both Windows legs for Redis,
the ARM64 one for Memcached, the ARM64 one for nginx. An empty cell stated in every run's log is
worth a runner minute; a row somebody has to remember is missing is not. See
[Redis and Memcached](packages/redis-memcached.md) and [nginx](packages/nginx.md) for why each of
those cells is empty.

`build-mariadb.yml` is the one that is shaped differently, and both differences are MariaDB's rather
than a preference. It runs **three** recipes across six legs, because upstream publishes a binary for
two cells, `.deb` packages for a third and nothing at all for the rest. And it takes a *list* of
versions — `all` expands to every supported series — because MariaDB maintains four at once with
end-of-life dates years apart, so a workflow that took one version would have to be invoked four
times and would miss one.

`build-mysql.yml` takes a list too, and is the one workflow here that does not write its matrix down
at all. Five lines are live at once, and **which recipe a cell uses depends on the version rather
than only on the cell** — 5.6 is compiled on macOS where 9.7 is borrowed — so `tools/mysql.py --plan`
produces the legs and the workflow reads them. The same command resolves each line to **one exact
version for every cell at once**, which is not fussiness: 8.0.45 published its Linux tarballs
unsigned while its macOS and Windows assets are signed, and a per-leg resolution would have split one
line across two releases with three cells in one and two in the other.

`build-postgres.yml` takes a list for the same reason, and runs **two** recipes across five legs: EDB
builds three of the six cells and the project's own `.deb` packages cover two more, leaving Windows
on ARM as the only cell nobody publishes anything for. The two macOS legs download the same universal
archive, which looks wasteful and is the point — what each one proves is that *this* Mach-O slice
starts and serves on *this* machine, and a single leg producing both artifacts could only ever have
run one of them.

The borrowed recipes share `tools/borrow.py` — downloading, hashing, unwrapping the publisher's
wrapper directory where there is one, packing, and running a program with a `PATH` the runner cannot
answer. What no two *kinds* share is the smoke test, deliberately: the mechanics are the same for
every publisher and the *claim* is not, and this repository has already been bitten once by two
producers writing the same manifest field to mean two different strengths of proof.

Inside a kind the opposite holds, and for the same reason read backwards. `ruby_smoke.py` is shared
by the two Ruby recipes, `mariadb_smoke.py` by three, `mysql_smoke.py` and `postgres_smoke.py` by two, precisely
*because* each set produces one runtime for one row of the table: two producers of the same thing
that check it differently will drift, and the drift is invisible because they agree on the field
name. Where the routes disagree about a tree's shape the shared module carries every spelling — see
`postgres_smoke.LAYOUT`, which is a table of them and not an `if`.
