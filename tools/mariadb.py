"""Borrow a MariaDB build from downloads.mariadb.org and repack it as a MixEngine artifact.

**The cell this repository expected to be cheap, and it is cheap in exactly two places.** MixEngine's
runtime table said "official zip / official tarball / official tarball" for all three systems. Asked
rather than assumed — which is what "borrow costs one evaluation" is for — the catalogue answers
something else, and the evaluation is written up in `MixEngine's runtime-packaging.md`_:

* **Windows x86_64** publishes ``mariadb-<version>-winx64.zip``. Borrowed here.
* **Linux x86_64** publishes ``mariadb-<version>-linux-systemd-x86_64.tar.gz``. Borrowed here.
* **Linux aarch64** publishes no tarball at all — only ``.deb`` packages, which ``mariadb_deb.py``
  takes apart.
* **macOS** publishes nothing, on either architecture, and never has: every release from 10.2 to 13.1
  offers Linux and Windows and nothing else. ``mariadb_build.py`` compiles those.
* **Windows aarch64** likewise publishes nothing. Same recipe, built natively on an ARM runner.

So this file is two of six cells, and the reason it is not simply :mod:`caddy` with a different table
is the second half of that sentence: **a borrowed MariaDB is not self-contained.** Caddy is one static
Go binary; a MariaDB bintar is a hundred programs and a plugin directory linked against whatever the
build machine had — OpenSSL, libaio, libnuma, libsystemd, PCRE2 — by soname, with no search path of
its own. Installed on a user's machine those are a different version or absent, and the failure is a
server that will not start with an error naming a file nobody installed. ``relocate.bundle`` therefore
runs over a *borrowed* tree here, which no other borrow recipe in this repository needs, and
``upstream.added`` records every library it put in.

Three further decisions:

*The REST API is the catalogue, and it is also the checksum.* ``downloads.mariadb.org/rest-api``
states, per release, every file with all four digests beside it. So what exists and what it should
hash to come out of one document from the publisher, which is the same trade the Node.js and Caddy
recipes make. Upstream also publishes a PGP signature per file, and it is deliberately not checked:
that would mean ``gpg`` and a key distribution on a runner with nothing installed, which is the same
dependency the Caddy recipe refused ``cosign`` for.

*Its download URLs are ``http://`` and are rewritten to ``https://``.* Not a preference. The digest
is fetched over the same channel as the file, so a plain-text download would let anything on the path
substitute both.

*And the file is fetched from the publisher's archive rather than from those URLs at all.* They are a
redirector to third-party mirrors, one of which served a 10.6.28 tarball 1,846 bytes short of the
published one — so the checksum comes from the REST API and the bytes come from
``archive.mariadb.org``, MariaDB's own host and the one ``mariadb_deb.py`` already uses. See
``ARCHIVE``.

*The test suite is not shipped.* ``mysql-test/`` and ``sql-bench/`` are more than half the unpacked
tree, are a developer's tool for testing the server rather than for running one, and nothing in
MixEngine reaches for them. They are named in ``upstream.removed`` rather than quietly dropped.

Python 3 stdlib only, by policy: this runs on a GitHub runner with nothing installed.
