"""Take the symbols out of a binary, and prove that nothing else went with them.

Written for P4b, where CPython's Unix cells were levelled down to the Windows one that already ships
no `.pdb`, and lifted out of `python.py` for P5b, where the Ruby row needs the same operation on
files of a shape P4b never had to describe. The argument for hoisting it is the one this repository
makes about every pair of producers that answer one question: two recipes stripping their own
binaries by their own rules would disagree about the same file, and nothing outside either recipe
could notice.

**The proof is structural, and it has to be.** The usual way to justify writing over a compiled file
is to run it afterwards, and that proof does not reach the files most at risk. CPython's
`lib/libpython3.X.so.1.0` and Ruby's `lib/libruby-static.a` are both things *nothing in their own
archive loads* — kept, and declared in `keeps`, because the tree's own build record hands an
embedder a link line naming them. A smoke test can start either interpreter a thousand times without
touching either file. So the claim is made by comparison instead: if everything a loader maps and
everything a linker reads is identical across the operation, the two files cannot behave
differently, and running them would say no more than that.

Which comparison that is depends on what the file is for, and the two are not the same claim.

:func:`mapped` is the loader's view, for an executable or a shared library. On ELF the split is
drawn by the hardware — `SHF_ALLOC` marks a section as part of the process image and a strip removes
only sections without it — and on Mach-O, which has no such bit, the line is drawn at `__LINKEDIT`,
the one segment that legitimately shrinks.

:func:`resolvable` is the linker's, for a static library, and it is P5b's addition. An `ar` archive
is not an image: a member is compiled and never mapped, `SHF_ALLOC` says nothing about what matters,
and what has to survive is every symbol an embedder resolves and every relocation that will be
applied when it does. Both are *renumbered* by a successful strip — removing `.debug_*` renumbers
the section headers, and removing a debug symbol renumbers the table every relocation indexes into —
so comparing those tables as bytes reports a difference on every run that worked. They are compared
**by name** instead, which is the question actually being asked: can this still be linked against.

Nothing here downloads or unpacks anything, and nothing here decides *which* files to strip; a
recipe knows what it built. Python 3 stdlib only, like everything else in this directory.

# What the platform's own `strip` is asked to do, and **not one of the four instructions is
# interchangeable with another**, which is the finding these tables exist to carry rather than a
# portability wrinkle.
#
# The rows differ by object format. ELF keeps two symbol tables and a linker only ever reads the
# allocated one: `.dynsym` has `SHF_ALLOC`, `strip` may not touch it, so `--strip-all` takes
# `.symtab` and everything anyone links against survives untouched. Mach-O keeps **one** —
# `LC_SYMTAB` holds the local, the exported and the undefined symbols in three ranges that
# `LC_DYSYMTAB` indexes — and the same instruction there empties the exported range: measured on
# `libpython3.13.dylib`, 1,755 exported symbols become 0 and `_Py_Initialize` stops existing in the
# file, to save 66 KB more than `-x` saves. So `-x`, which discards the local range and is what the
# exported one is defined against.
#
# The columns differ by what the file is *for*, and that is P5b's half. An image is loaded and its
# symbol table is dead weight. A static library is linked against, and its symbol table is the
# entire point — `--strip-all` over `libruby-static.a` takes it from 41.4 MB to 7.9 MB and leaves a
# file that resolves nothing, which is a broken artifact no smoke test in this repository would
# catch, because nothing inside either tree links against that file either. An archive therefore
# gets `--strip-debug`, which removes the `.debug_*` sections and the symbols that only describe
# them.
#
# Windows is absent from both tables, and the absence is the argument rather than an omission:
# python-build-standalone's stripped variant ships no `.pdb` at all — zero files, of 3,303 — and
# RubyInstaller links with `-s`, visible in the `DLDFLAGS` its own `.pc` publishes. Both Windows
# cells have already had this done to them by their publisher, and levelling the other four down to
# them is the same move, in the same direction, that `python.prune` made with tkinter.

    says what it contains twice — the section headers, which a *linker* reads, and the program
    headers, which the *loader* reads — and nothing enforces that the two describe the same file.
    GNU `strip` works from the section table and writes a new program header table out of it, so
    where the two disagree it does not preserve the disagreement: it resolves it, in the section
    table's favour, and whatever the loader was reaching through the old segments stops being
    mapped.

    That is not hypothetical and it is not rare enough to leave to chance. python-build-standalone
    runs BOLT over the `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` interpreter, and BOLT moves `.dynstr`'s 45 KB of
    bytes to the end of the file while leaving its `sh_addr` at ``0x3ff5a0``, inside the first
    ``PT_LOAD`` — where the bytes are not. `strip --strip-all` says so itself, in a warning nobody
    reads (``allocated section `.dynstr' not in segment``), shrinks that segment from ``0x1000`` to
    ``0x5a0``, and produces an interpreter whose ``DT_STRTAB`` points at unmapped memory: every
    dynamic symbol name reads back as the empty string and the process dies before `main` with
    ``undefined symbol: , version``. Measured on binutils 2.42, the version ubuntu-24.04 runs, by
    running the binary before and after and restoring it in between. `lib/libpython3.14.so.1.0` in
    the same archive has a consistent layout, strips cleanly, and is worth four times the saving.
    :func:`mapped` catches the damage after the fact — it is what caught this — but by then the only
    copy of the file has been overwritten, so the answer has to be asked first.

    Read from the file, not from `strip`'s warning, because a warning is a string on stderr that a
    future binutils may reword and because this has to be true of a file rather than of a tool.

    **One operation for every recipe, because it was two and they were drifting.** MariaDB stripped
    its bintar and its `.deb` cells and nothing else did — CPython and Ruby strip for a different
    reason and with different flags, MySQL stripped nothing at all until a 609 MB Linux artifact was
    measured against a 109 MB macOS one, and redis, nginx and memcached compile here and ship what
    the compiler left. Nothing outside each recipe could have noticed, which is the argument this
    module's own docstring makes about every pair of producers answering one question.

    The saving is not marginal at either end. MariaDB 11.8.8 packs to 27 MB from upstream's
    own arm64 `.deb` packages and to 371 MB from its x86_64 bintar — the same database, the
    same compression — because Debian strips its binaries and ships the symbols in a separate
    `-dbg` package while the bintar carries them inside every executable and every plugin.
    Redis compiles here and its Linux artifact was 21.2 MB of DWARF in a 28.9 MB tree.

    ``--strip-debug`` rather than the ``--strip-all`` of :data:`IMAGES`, and the difference is not
    caution. A runtime tree is full of things that are linked against and loaded *by name*:
    `lib/plugin/*.so` reached through `dlopen`, `lib/libmysqlclient.so` and `lib/libmariadb.so`
    reached by a client extension, `lib/libpython3.X.so` reached by an embedder. The allocated
    symbol table is what makes those work, `strip` may not touch it on ELF anyway, and it is not
    what makes a binary large — measured on MySQL 9.7.1, where `.debug_*` was five sixths of the
    Linux tree while every symbol a loader or a linker can see survived byte for byte.

    Linux only, measured rather than assumed: DWARF is linked into an ELF executable and stays
    behind in the object files of a Mach-O one, so the macOS cells of ten packages carry none, and
    `strip -x` on a signed arm64 binary would cost a re-signature to buy back nothing.

    Only the files that have some are touched, so what comes back is what changed and the tree's
    other binaries are still upstream's bytes — which is the difference between an artifact whose

    """A relocatable Mach-O reduced to what a linker resolves through it, and to nothing a strip is
    entitled to rebuild.

    **`strip -S` on macOS does not remove debug information from an object; it reassembles the
    object without it.** That is the thing P5c cost three CI round trips to learn, and it is not a
    detail — measured on the published `ruby-3.2.11-macos-aarch64` archive, the operation reorders
    the sections, reorders the *functions inside* `__text` (`_rb_warn` moves from `0x850` to
    `0xa540`), renames every local label (`l_.str` becomes `LC1`), coalesces duplicate literals,
    turns section-relative relocations into references to the symbol sitting there, and rewrites
    `__eh_frame`'s internal distances as explicit relocations. Stripping the same object outside the
    archive reproduces all of it byte for byte, so it is `strip`'s behaviour and not the archive's.

    Nothing a linker resolves is lost in any of that: across all 496 Mach-O members of that archive,
    all 6,159 defined external symbols survive, every atom is identical byte for byte once its
    relocated fields are read as the names they point at, and no member's set of undefined externals
    changes. So the comparison is made of what survives, and made in a way that cannot see the rest:

    * an atom, not a section, is the unit — bounded by the symbols in it, or for the three kinds of
      section that carry their own structure, by that structure;
    * a reference is what it *names*, never where its target sat: an external symbol by name, one of
      this object's own places by the contents of the atom it lands in, since a local label's name
      is not preserved either;
    * a `SUBTRACTOR` pair encodes a distance from an anchor the two assemblers put in different
      places, so it is read as the thing it names and the distance is dropped;
    * addresses, section order, atom order and the assembler's section flags are absent.

    The line for debug information is where the compiler drew it: DWARF lives in sections whose
    *segment* is `__DWARF`, and debug symbols are the `N_STAB` entries — the same distinction the
    symbol table makes itself, and exactly what `strip -S` exists to remove.

    What this gives up, stated rather than discovered later, and all of it in the unwind tables:
    which CIE an FDE belongs to, how far an FDE or a `__compact_unwind` record says its function
    runs, and where either says the exception table is. Each of those is a distance or an address,
    each is a bare constant before this operation and a relocation after it — and a span there
    covers the function *and* the padding behind it, which an alignment moves. The function every
    one of them is about is compared, by name, and so is everything else in them.

    Everything a linker can reach is still compared, which seven deliberate corruptions of a real
    member confirm on both macOS cells: a flipped instruction byte, a renamed global, an altered
    unwind encoding, a relocation aimed at the next symbol, a changed C string, a changed CFI
    instruction and sixteen zeroed bytes of `__const` are each refused. The one edit that is *not*
    refused is a byte inside a relocated field, which is the point of blanking them: the linker
    overwrites those bytes on its way in, so what they hold here is not what anything runs.
