"""Where every date in ``data/eol.json`` came from, and the thing that keeps it true.

``data/eol.json`` is the only claim this repository makes that is not about bytes. Everything else
in an artifact is measured — a digest, a load command, a version a binary printed about itself — and
can be re-measured from the archive years later. "Upstream stops patching this line on the 30th of
April 2027" cannot. It is a transcription, and until this file existed four of the six kinds were
transcribed **by hand from a web page, with nothing checking them**.

That is not a hypothetical worry. The first run of :func:`check` found, in Ruby alone:

* **3.2 was wrong** — written 2026-03-31, upstream says 2026-04-01. Off by one day, from a schedule
  page that says "March" in prose and 1 April in its data.
* **3.4 and 4.0 were invented.** Upstream states no end date for either. Both had been extrapolated
  from Ruby's habit of ending a line on 31 March about four years on, which is a good guess and is
  still this repository's opinion printed in a field that means "upstream says".
* **3.3 was right by luck** — the number matches upstream's, but upstream files it under
  ``expected_eol_date`` rather than ``eol_date``, which is a different claim.

PHP, Node.js, Python, MariaDB and PostgreSQL were all correct to the day. That is the shape of this
class of bug: it is not that hand-transcription is usually wrong, it is that nothing tells you which
of the forty-four entries is the one that is.

**Six publishers, six machine-readable documents, and no mirror.** The roadmap expected two of these
to need ``endoflife.date``. None of them do:

===========  =====================================================================================
``php``      ``php.net/releases/branches.php`` — JSON, no query string needed, 24 branches with
             ``security_support_end``. php.net renders ``supported-versions.php`` from the same data
             and this is the machine half of it.
``node``     ``nodejs/Release``'s ``schedule.json`` — the file the Node.js release working group
             edits when it moves a date, keyed ``v22`` with an ``end``.
``python``   ``peps.python.org/api/release-cycle.json`` — the document the developer's guide itself
             consumes; ``devguide/_tools/generate_release_cycle.py`` reads this exact URL to draw the
             chart on ``devguide.python.org/versions/``.
``ruby``     ``ruby/www.ruby-lang.org``'s ``_data/branches.yml`` — the data file the branches page is
             generated from.
``mariadb``  ``downloads.mariadb.org/rest-api/mariadb`` — already the catalogue ``mariadb.py``
             resolves a version against; ``release_eol_date`` per series.
``postgres`` ``postgresql.org/versions.json`` — already the catalogue ``postgres.py`` resolves a
             version against; ``eolDate`` per major.
===========  =====================================================================================

Four decisions this file is answerable for.

*The check runs on a clock, not on a pack, because the MariaDB pattern does not generalise.*
``mariadb.py`` prints the end-of-life date it saw on every run, and that works because the date
arrives in the same document the download does — it costs nothing and it catches a moved schedule
the next time that series is packed. But an end-of-life date does not change when a version is
packed; it changes on a calendar. And the lines closest to their date are precisely the lines nobody
is packing any more: Ruby 3.2 reached its end in April 2026 and would never have been repacked, so
the wrong date above would have sat in the index until a human happened to look. So the check is a
scheduled workflow over the whole file, and per-recipe printing (:func:`announce`) is kept as the
cheap half — it reads what is written down, makes no network call, and cannot fail a build.

*The whole of each publisher's document is transcribed, not the lines this repository offers.* The
file used to hold a curated 38 entries and the curation was the problem: a subset cannot be checked,
because nothing distinguishes a line deliberately left out from one forgotten. Transcribing the
document in full makes the check an **equality**, which is the only kind of check that catches an
omission. It also costs nothing — ``mkindex.py`` reads the lines it needs and ignores the rest — and
it dates an artifact of PHP 5.6 correctly if one is ever republished, without anybody deciding to.

*Ruby falls back to ``expected_eol_date``, and the fallback is named in the output.* Ruby is the only
one of the six that does not state a future date: ``eol_date`` is filled in when a branch actually
ends, and a branch in security maintenance carries ``expected_eol_date`` instead. Refusing the
expectation would leave Ruby 3.3 undated while PHP 8.5 carries a date four years further out — and
PHP's, Node's and Python's future dates are *also* plans that can move, which is what this check is
for. So an expectation is transcribed and the field it came from is printed beside it. What is not
transcribed is the case upstream is silent on: Ruby 3.4 and 4.0 have no date here, per line rather
than per kind, for the reason ``data/eol.json`` gives about Caddy.

*Ruby's document is YAML and there is a twenty-line reader for it rather than a dependency or a
mirror.* Python's standard library has no YAML, this repository installs nothing on a runner, and
the alternative — ``endoflife.date`` — is a third party restating what ruby-lang.org already
publishes. The file it publishes is a flat list of ``key: value``, which is a shape that can be read
honestly; :func:`_yaml` reads exactly that shape and **raises on anything else**, so the day
ruby-lang.org nests something is the day this stops rather than the day it starts guessing.

Python 3 stdlib only, by policy: this runs on a GitHub runner with nothing installed.
