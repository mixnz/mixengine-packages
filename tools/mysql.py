"""What both MySQL recipes have to agree about: which versions exist, what upstream published for
each of them, who signed it, and what a MySQL tree is cut down to before it is packed.

**Oracle publishes no REST API and no ``versions.json``.** MariaDB states its catalogue and its
checksums in one document; MySQL states its catalogue in a rendered archive page and its checksums
in an MD5 nothing here would write into ``upstream.verified_against``. So the catalogue is parsed —
which is a cost, and it is smaller than the alternative of a version list kept in this repository
that goes stale the day a patch is published.

Two things measured on a runner rather than assumed, and both read backwards:

*Send urllib's default User-Agent and never a browser's.* Every archive URL carrying a query string
answers **403** to a browser ``User-Agent`` from a datacentre address and **200** to
``Python-urllib/3``. The local probe that found the 403 had been told to be polite and send one, so
the courteous choice is the one that gets blocked — which is the sort of thing
``building-from-source.md`` exists to record.

*A 200 is not an answer.* The archive returns ``200 text/html`` with a body reading "Technical
Difficulties" rather than a status a client can branch on, so :func:`page` reads what came back and
not only how it came back.

Nothing here packs anything. :mod:`mysql_borrow` takes the cells upstream publishes a binary for,
:mod:`mysql_build` compiles the ones it does not, and ``--plan`` tells the workflow which is which.

Python 3 stdlib only, by policy: this runs on a GitHub runner with nothing installed.
