"""Borrow a PHP build from windows.php.net, make it agree with the other five cells, and repack it.

Nothing here compiles PHP. The official Windows builds are already relocatable — T20a extracted one,
moved it to an unrelated directory and ran it from there — so the whole job is to fetch the right
zip, prove it runs after being moved, describe what is inside it, and repack.

What it does *not* borrow is the extension set. Until P2 this recipe packed whatever the publisher
put in the zip, and the publisher's answer is not MixEngine's: PHP 8.3 on Windows shipped without
``redis`` and ``mongodb``, which the Unix recipes fail a build over, and with an ODBC bridge, an
Oracle client, ``dl_test`` and ``zend_test``. So the set is now chosen — `php_parity` holds the
choice for all three recipes — and this one reaches it in two moves the Unix recipes make at
configure time: **what is missing is downloaded** from PECL's own Windows builds, and **what nothing
here needs is thrown away**, along with the libraries that were only in the archive to serve it.

Three things this deliberately does not do:

*It does not rearrange the directory.* ``php.exe`` resolves its DLLs from its own directory, so
normalising the tree into ``bin``/``lib`` would produce an archive that only fails at run time. The
layout stays as its publisher shipped it and ``mixengine-artifact.json`` says where things are.

*It does not use the TS build.* ``php-cgi.exe`` behind FastCGI is how a Windows site is served, and
that wants the non-thread-safe build; the thread-safe one exists for an in-process module SAPI
MixEngine does not use.

*It does not mix compiler tags.* A PECL extension built for a different ``vc``/``vs`` tag than the
PHP it is loaded into is a different C runtime, not a version to warn about, so an extension with no
build for this exact tag is treated as one that does not exist.

Python 3 stdlib only, by policy: this runs on a GitHub runner with nothing installed.

    are static and never consult it — and the official build bakes ``C:\\php\\ext``, an absolute path
    that exists on nobody's machine. So the test that matters is the second one.

    **Every** extension, not the first one that loads. This half used to stop at the first, which
    was enough to prove ``extension_dir`` was honoured and nothing else, while the Unix half proved
    all of them — the exact drift `php_smoke` exists to name, with `smoke.loaded_extension` meaning
    a weaker thing on one cell than on the other five. It is load-bearing rather than tidy, too:
    :func:`prune` deletes libraries by reachability, and an extension whose DLL went with them is
    only visible here.

    **And before either, that nothing in the tree reaches outside it.** This row had no
    `relocate.verify` at all — not a guarded one like the other five Windows cells P6a opened, none —
    because when it was written `relocate` judged a file by its magic and had nothing to say about a
    PE. Loading every extension is a strong check and it is not this one: it exercises `ext/` and the
    libraries `ext/` pulls in, while `php8.dll`, the eleven ICU and OpenSSL DLLs beside it and
    `extras/ssl/legacy.dll` are loaded by nothing here. `("",)` rather than the default for the
    reason `node` and `python` found: this tree keeps its payload at the root, where the default
    scan — which does find `ext/` — sees 37 of its 63 binaries.
