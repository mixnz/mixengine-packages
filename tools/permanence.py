"""Check that every asset the published index names is still there, and still the bytes it claims.

The index is a promise about the past. A blueprint pinning PHP 8.1.29 has to keep installing years
after 8.1 stopped being built, which makes every release asset this repository has ever uploaded
load-bearing — not archived, not historical, *in use*. Nothing in GitHub knows that. A release can be
deleted from a web page in two clicks, and until this file existed the only thing that would have
noticed was a user whose install failed.

**Deleting one is not recoverable, and that is the part worth being clear about.** The obvious reading
is that a lost artifact can be rebuilt from the recipe that made it, and it can — but not to the same
bytes. These are compressed archives packed at a different minute, by a different runner, from
sources that may themselves have moved; the sha256 in the index will not match, and the index is
signed. Restoring means publishing a *different* artifact under the same version and re-signing an
index that now describes it differently, which every client that pinned the old hash is entitled to
read as tampering. So the recovery is a break, and the only real defence is to find out fast.

Two claims, and they cost three orders of magnitude apart:

* **Still there.** One ``HEAD`` per asset. Four hundred requests, a few seconds, no bandwidth.
* **Still the same bytes.** A download of the whole archive. Six gigabytes today, and one more
  version of one more runtime adds six cells to that.

So the first is done for everything, every run, and the second for a fixed *fraction* of the archive
— which is the choice worth explaining. A count ("hash twenty of them") keeps the run cheap and lets
coverage decay as the archive grows; a fraction keeps coverage constant and lets the run grow. The
promise being checked is about coverage, so coverage is what is held fixed: with the default eight
slices, every asset is hashed within eight weeks no matter how many there are, and the bill grows the
same way the archive does. Which slice an asset falls in is derived from its URL rather than from its
position in the index, so a version published mid-cycle joins one fixed slice and is hashed within
the cycle instead of shuffling everything else out of the one it was in.

The manifests are checked too, and they are the half nothing else looks at: ``publish-index.yml``
does not rebuild the index from this repository's memory, it downloads every release asset and reads
the ``<archive>.json`` beside each one. A deleted sidecar leaves the archive perfectly intact and
quietly removes that version from every index generated afterwards. It is not named in the index —
it is the input the index is made *from* — so it is derived here rather than read.

Separate from ``verify.py`` on purpose: that one checks a candidate index before it is signed, and a
failure there means "do not publish this". This one checks the index that is already published and
already trusted, and a failure means "something outside this repository changed under us".

Python 3 stdlib only, like everything else here.
