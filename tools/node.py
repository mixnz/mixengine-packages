"""Borrow a Node.js build from nodejs.org and repack it as a MixEngine artifact.

Nothing here compiles Node. The official builds are already relocatable — they are the same tarball
every version manager on earth unpacks into a directory of its own — so the whole job is to fetch the
right one, prove it still runs after being moved, describe what is inside it, and repack.

**One recipe for every target**, unlike PHP, which needs three. There is nothing per-OS here beyond
a file name and where the executables sit inside the tree, so a second script would be the same
script with a different table in it.

**What it does choose is what the tree keeps**, which is the whole of :func:`prune` and the one
decision this recipe makes rather than inherits. Upstream ships a different set of surplus to each
platform — 59 MB of C++ headers to Unix, a Chocolatey installer to Windows — and taking whichever
one the publisher happened to pick would make one version mean two things.

Three things this deliberately does not do:

*It does not rearrange the directory.* ``npm`` is a script that finds ``node`` relative to its own
location, so moving the two apart produces an archive that fails at run time and not at pack time.
The layout stays as its publisher shipped it and ``mixengine-artifact.json`` says where things are.

*It does not keep the top-level ``node-v22.11.0-linux-x64/`` directory.* That is the one rearrangement
made, and it is forced: MixEngine unpacks an archive straight into ``runtimes/node/<version>/`` and
every path in ``provides`` is relative to that, so a preserved wrapper directory would put the whole
runtime one level below where the index says it is.

*It does not verify a GPG signature.* Node signs ``SHASUMS256.txt`` with a keyring of a dozen
release keys that has to be fetched from a keyserver, which is a moving dependency on a machine with
nothing installed. What is checked is the published SHA-256 over HTTPS to the publisher, which is
exactly what the PHP recipe settles for and is recorded in the manifest as such.

Everything mechanical — downloading, hashing, unwrapping, packing, and running something with a
``PATH`` the runner cannot answer — moved to :mod:`borrow` when Python and Ruby arrived and needed
the identical five functions. What stays here is the resolution against upstream's index and the
smoke test, because those are claims about Node.js rather than about archives.

Python 3 stdlib only, by policy: this runs on a GitHub runner with nothing installed.

    """Drop everything at the root that is not this runtime, and answer with what went.

    **``include/node`` is what this exists to settle**, and it is settled by dropping it rather than
    by fetching it for Windows too. It is 59.0 MB of the 198.5 MB Linux archive of 24.19.0 — 2,726
    headers, byte for byte the publisher's own ``node-v24.19.0-headers.tar.gz`` — and the Windows
    zip has never carried a single one of them.

    The reading that says keep them is that ``node-gyp`` needs headers to build a native module, and
    it does. What it does not do is read *these*. ``node-gyp`` only looks inside the runtime it is
    running under when the build set ``use_prefix_to_find_headers``, which is a flag distributions
    pass so their ``-dev`` package can be used offline; **every official build has it false**, read
    here out of the ``process.config`` baked into the Linux 24.19.0 and 26.7.0 binaries rather than
    assumed. With it false the path is not a choice: ``configure.js`` downloads
    ``process.release.headersUrl`` into ``~/.node-gyp/<version>`` and compiles against that. Which
    is why native modules have always built on Windows against an archive with no ``include`` at
    all — the platform that already answers the question is the one this repository is copying.

    The other half of the argument is that *keep them everywhere* is not reachable even if it were
    wanted. Pointing ``node-gyp --nodedir`` at an installed tree on Windows makes it link against
    ``<nodedir>/$(Configuration)/node.lib`` — a path out of a **build** tree, which the headers
    tarball has never contained and which upstream publishes separately, per architecture. So the
    symmetric option is not "add 59 MB to three cells", it is "add 59 MB and a fourth download, and
    then still be told the two halves are not the same thing".

    **A keep-list, for the reason ``php_parity`` gives**: a list of what to delete is written
    against the one archive somebody measured. Measured across 16.20.2, 20.19.5, 24.19.0 and
    26.7.0 on both platforms, a delete-list naming ``include`` and ``share/{doc,man}`` would have
    shipped Node 16's ``share/systemtap`` and its ``node_etw_provider.man``, neither of which
    anything here knew existed. The keep-list drops both without being told, and drops whatever
    Node 28 invents.

    What goes, then: ``include/`` and ``share/`` on Unix; ``install_tools.bat`` — which is not a
    tool but a Chocolatey install of Python and the VC build tools onto the whole machine — and
    ``nodevars.bat`` on Windows; ``README.md`` and ``CHANGELOG.md`` on both, the second of which is
    also the only file whose *contents* differ between the two cells for a reason that is not line
    endings (617 KB of release notes on Unix against 56 KB on Windows, in 24.19.0).

    What stays, having been checked rather than assumed: npm's 2.7 MB of ``docs/`` and ``man/``,
    which read like the obvious next thing to throw out and are not. ``npm help-search`` reads
    ``docs/content``, ``npm help`` opens ``docs/output/*.html`` on Windows and runs ``man`` against
    ``man/man[1-7]`` on Unix. All three are load-bearing for a documented command, both cells carry
    all three already, and the rule asks for what is needed rather than for what is small.
