"""Check an index before it is signed.

A signature says "this is the file we published". It says nothing about whether the file is right,
and once signed a wrong index is a wrong index every client will happily trust. So the checks that
matter run first.

Three of them cannot be expressed in JSON Schema and are the ones most worth having:

1. **No version was lost.** The index is cumulative by promise. Comparing against the published one
   is the only thing that can catch a generator bug that silently drops a package.
2. **Every URL is ours.** An upstream URL passes every structural check and then breaks years later,
   for exactly the old pinned versions the promise was made about.
3. **Every artifact is reachable and hashes to what is claimed** — optional, because it costs a
   download of the whole index, and worth it before a release.

Needs ``jsonschema`` for the structural half; the invariants above run without it.
