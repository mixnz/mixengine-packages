"""Generate the signed index from the artifacts that exist.

The index is **cumulative and never loses a version**: a blueprint pinning PHP 8.1.29 has to keep
working years after 8.1 stopped being built. So this reads whatever index is already published,
merges the new artifacts into it, and writes the union. A run that produced nothing still writes a
valid index — the same one, with a new timestamp.

That is also why it refuses to emit an upstream URL. Every ``url`` points at a release asset of this
repository, because upstream hosts prune and the promise above would then be a lie for exactly the
old versions it was made about.

Python 3 stdlib only. Signing is minisign's job, not this script's — see ``publish-index.yml``.
