"""Compile Redis from upstream source for the five cells that can run it, and say so about the one.

**P8 read the Windows question as "is there a Windows build system", and that was the wrong
question.** There is not one, and re-reading the 8.10.0 tarball on a runner confirms it: no
``CMakeLists.txt``, no ``win32/``, no project file, and a ``src/Makefile`` around POSIX ``fork()``,
``epoll`` and ``kqueue``. No tag of ``redis/redis`` from 2.6 to 8.10 has ever contained one; the
Windows support that existed lived in ``microsoftarchive/redis``, a separate fork with its own
``msvs/`` and ``src/Win32_Interop``, which stopped at 3.0.504 in 2016.

But a program does not need to be *ported* to run somewhere — it needs the interfaces it calls. Both
of the routes that supply POSIX on Windows compile this source unmodified, and this recipe takes
the more conservative of them: **Cygwin**, whose runtime is documented for redistribution and whose
licence and runtime exception ship as files an archive can carry, over MSYS2, whose own
documentation says its runtime is for its build tools rather than for programs to be distributed.
Whatever the build actually imports travels beside the binaries — measured off the import table, not
copied from anyone's list — and is the only thing outside ``C:\\Windows`` the result loads. How many
that is depends on the line rather than on this recipe: one, ``cygwin1.dll``, for 7.2, 7.4, 8.8 and
8.10, and five for 8.0 through 8.6, which vendor the C++ ``fast_float`` and so pull in
``cygstdc++-6.dll`` with ``cygiconv-2.dll``, ``cygintl-8.dll`` and ``cyggcc_s-seh-1.dll`` behind it.

The alternatives are still no, and for the reasons P8 gave. **Valkey** is the same POSIX program
forked and sends a Windows user to WSL, which
[ADR 0003](https://github.com/mixnz/mixengine/blob/master/.claude/decisions/0003-no-container-isolation.md)
excludes. **Memurai** is proprietary; a repository that redistributes what it packs cannot pack one.
**The community rebuilds** are a fork nobody maintains — and the point of compiling here is that
their *method* can be borrowed without their binaries: the tarball is upstream's, checked against
upstream's own digest, and nothing in it is patched.

What that costs, stated rather than smoothed over. Cygwin has no ``epoll``, so ``ae.c`` falls to its
``select`` backend, and the runtime cannot raise the descriptor limit as far as the default asks, so
``maxclients`` settles lower. Both are properties of one unreplicated development instance on a
developer's own machine, which is the only thing MixEngine runs. And ``windows/aarch64`` stays empty:
neither Cygwin nor MSYS2 has an ARM64 build, x86_64 under emulation would work, and an artifact
labelled ``aarch64`` may not hold binaries that are not.

One more Windows cell is empty and it is a *version* rather than an architecture: 7.2 builds there
and then faults in its own startup, which :data:`WINDOWS_FLOOR` states in full. Its four Unix cells
are packed as usual.

What the five cells get:

*Core Redis, and none of the bundled modules.* Since 8.0 the release tarball vendors RediSearch,
RedisJSON, RedisTimeSeries, RedisBloom and vector-sets — 6,671 files, and the reason the 8.10.0
tarball is 21 MB where 7.2.15 is 3.4 MB. Building them wants LLVM 21, Rust 1.94 and a CMake pinned
between 3.25 and 3.31.6, on four targets, for every security release, to ship data structures a
local web development environment does not reach for; and it would make the 7.2 cells of this row
mean something different from the 8.x ones, since 7.x has no modules to build. Upstream supplies the
switch by name — ``scripts/build.sh redis`` is "Redis only, no modules" — and what that script does
for the core is ``make -C src all``, which is what this recipe runs directly so that one code path
serves 7.x and 8.x alike.

*No TLS.* ``BUILD_TLS=yes`` links OpenSSL, which is then a library to bundle, a version to keep
current and a floor to measure, in exchange for encrypting a loopback connection between two
processes on a developer's own machine. Left off, ``redis-server`` imports nothing outside the C
runtime on Linux and nothing outside ``libSystem`` on macOS — the artifact is self-contained the way
Caddy's is, and ``relocate.verify`` is what says so rather than this paragraph.

*Nothing to relocate, which is worth stating because it is rare here.* Redis compiles no prefix into
anything: the server takes its configuration from ``argv`` and resolves nothing relative to where it
was built. Every other built row in this repository spends most of its length on that problem.

*The version and its digest come from the same document.* ``redis/redis-hashes`` is upstream's own
catalogue of every published tarball with a SHA-256 and a URL per line, which is the trade
``caddy.py`` makes with ``caddy_<version>_checksums.txt`` and ``mariadb_build.py`` makes with the
MariaDB REST API: what exists and what it should hash to are read from one place, so a digest can
never be taken from a different release than the archive it is checked against.

Python 3 stdlib only, by policy: this runs on a GitHub runner with nothing installed.

# **Windows starts one line higher, and it is Redis 7.2 that says so rather than Cygwin.** 7.2.15

# it prints anything. Traced on a `windows-2022` runner with Cygwin's own `strace`: the last system
# call is `time(0)`, then `exception c0000005` — an access violation — which Cygwin turns into
# signal 11 and exits with `0xB00`, the wait status of a process killed by SIGSEGV.
#
# Everything that could have made it an accident was ruled out on the same runner. `redis-cli.exe`,
# from the same compiler, the same flags and the same `cygwin1.dll` beside it, answers
# `redis-cli 7.2.15` and exits 0. The unmoved tree faults identically to the relocated one, so it is
# not `borrow.moved`. `cygcheck` reads the import table as `cygwin1.dll` and Windows API sets and
# nothing else, so nothing is missing. And the code it dies in — `tzset`, `gettimeofday`, `srand`,
# `init_genrand64`, `crc64_init`, between `time()` and the banner — is **byte for byte the same in
# 7.4.10**, which builds and runs on this cell. So it is the older source and this toolchain
# disagreeing, in a way that no evidence here places in Redis, in Cygwin, or in the recipe.
#
# What is not done about it, and why. Patching the source is what "nothing in it is patched" exists
# to refuse. Compiling this one line differently — a lower `-O`, another `-f` — would make the
# 7.2 Windows artifact a different build from the four Unix cells of its own version, which is the
