"""Compile memcached from upstream source for the five cells that can run it, and say so about one.

**The reason this recipe used to give for the Windows cells was wrong, and it was measured wrong
rather than argued wrong.** What it said was that memcached has "a privilege-dropping source file
for every Unix and none for Windows" — which describes the source tree accurately and then draws a
conclusion the source tree does not support. Every ``*_priv.c`` sits behind an ``AM_CONDITIONAL``
(``Makefile.am:39-57``, ``configure.ac:841-845``) and is **off by default**: optional hardening
reached through ``--enable-seccomp`` or a platform probe, not a component the program needs. Built
under Cygwin the generated ``config.h`` carries ``/* #undef HAVE_DROP_PRIVILEGES */`` and the build
completes anyway. ``eventfd``, ``accept4`` and ``mlockall`` are each an ``AC_CHECK_FUNCS`` with a
fallback and are undefined there too, with the same result.

So the true statement is **no native Win32 build system** — no ``CMakeLists.txt``, no ``win32/``,
no project file — which is a statement about what upstream ships, not about what the program can
be. Under Cygwin it builds on this recipe's own ``configure`` line with no flag added and no file
in either tarball patched, and the result runs as an ordinary Windows process: started from a
directory the build never named, on a trimmed ``PATH``, answering the text protocol and stopping on
a terminate.

*What that cell costs, said here rather than found in a tree.* A Cygwin binary links
``cygwin1.dll``, so the Windows archive is **two files rather than one** and the second is
**LGPLv3** — a licence text to ship and a source route to offer, both of which
:func:`relocate.bundled_licences` does, and a "this imports nothing outside the C runtime" claim
that holds for the four Unix cells and not for this one.

*And ``windows``/``aarch64`` stays empty*, for the reason ``nginx.py`` states about its own: Cygwin
has no aarch64 port — the toolchain and runtime are not upstream and package porting has not begun
— so the only thing that could fill that cell is this x86_64 image under emulation, and publishing
it in an archive whose manifest says ``arch: aarch64`` would be a lie in the index.
``docs/building-from-source.md`` already refuses that for the whole repository: *nothing here
cross-compiles and nothing runs under emulation*. Whether MixEngine should install the x86_64
archive on a Windows ARM machine and say so is a question for the daemon, where the user can see
the answer.

What the five cells get:

*A static libevent, pinned here rather than taken from the machine.* memcached is a thin layer over
an event loop and links nothing else. Taking the runner's libevent would make each artifact carry
whatever that image happened to have — the thing this repository levels out everywhere else — and
would leave a shared object to bundle and re-point afterwards. Compiled static into the binary
instead, the Unix artifact is one file that imports nothing outside the C runtime, and
``relocate.verify`` is what says so rather than this paragraph. The version is written down with its
SHA-256 and checked, which is one better than :mod:`ruby_unix` does for the three libraries it pins,
and it costs three lines.

*The Windows dependency question is :mod:`relocate`'s, and this file used to answer it a second
time.* It had to, once: ``relocate.kind`` judged a file by its first four bytes, answered ``None``
for ``MZ``, and ``verify`` therefore *passed without looking* at a Windows tree — so ninety lines of
``cygcheck`` were written here instead, and they worked. Then Redis taught :mod:`relocate` to parse
the import table out of the file itself, and one question had two answers in one repository. **The
difference cost a red build within a day.** The parser knows ``api-ms-win-*`` is a virtual name the
loader resolves from a schema; ``cygcheck`` does not, and resolves all twenty-seven of them through
its own ``PATH`` into a Java toolcache. The rule was then taught here separately, which fixed the
build and left the divergence in place. So the second answer is gone: this recipe calls
:func:`relocate.bundle` with ``libdir="bin"`` and :func:`relocate.verify` exactly as ``redis.py``
does, and what is left of Cygwin in this file is the *toolchain* — a compiler reached by absolute
path — rather than a second opinion about PE.

The mechanism that survived is also the better one, and not by much of an argument: ``cygcheck``
exists only where Cygwin is installed, which is to say only on the build machine, and answers with
what *that* machine's ``PATH`` offers rather than with what the file requires. Reading the import
table needs neither.

*No TLS, no SASL, no proxy.* Each is a ``configure`` flag, a dependency and a feature of a cache
somebody else operates. MixEngine supervises one instance on loopback for one developer.

*No ``shutdown`` command, deliberately.* ``--enable-shutdown`` would give the supervisor a graceful
stop to send, and what it actually gives is an unauthenticated ``shutdown`` verb on a loopback port
that any page served by the same machine can reach.
[ADR 0008](https://github.com/mixnz/mixengine/blob/master/.claude/decisions/0008-no-signal-stop-on-windows.md)
already names Memcached as a service where stopping without a signal costs nothing — a cache has
nothing unflushed to lose — so the smoke test stops it the way the supervisor will, by terminating
it, and checks that it goes.

*The digest is upstream's SHA-1, and that is worth saying plainly rather than smoothing over.*
memcached publishes a ``<tarball>.sha1`` beside every release and publishes nothing stronger. SHA-1
is not collision-resistant, so what this check is worth is what it is: proof that the bytes fetched
over TLS from memcached.org are the bytes memcached.org describes, and not proof against an attacker
who can choose both halves of a pair. The transport is doing most of the work here, which is the
honest description and the reason the recipe prints which algorithm it used.

Python 3 stdlib only, by policy: this runs on a GitHub runner with nothing installed.
