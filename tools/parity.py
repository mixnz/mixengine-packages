"""Compare the artifacts of one version to each other, and each of them to the rule.

Every other check in this repository reads one artifact. A smoke test proves an archive runs;
`borrow.declare` proves a recipe's claims against the tree that made them; `verify.py` proves the
index is well formed and points at our own mirror. Every one of them passes on an archive that is
perfectly self-consistent and does something none of its five siblings do — which is the whole of
what [*One version means one thing, and no more than is needed*][rule] forbids. A rule about a set
of artifacts cannot be enforced by anything that looks at one of them.

**Both halves of it were found by hand before they were written down here.** The first audit of a
green MariaDB run — six cells, every one proven against a running server — found four asymmetries no
recipe knew it had. P2 then packed five branches of PHP without GD, because a keep-list matched
`php_gd2.dll` against a name PHP changed in 8.0, and every check passed: what is missing cannot fail
a load test. Twice, and both times by comparing rather than by reading.

So there are two checks, and they read different things.

*Across the cells of one version*, the feature set has to match. What a feature set **is** differs
by kind, and only there: for PHP it is ``extensions.static ∪ extensions.enabled`` — what a cell
actually runs with, as against ``shared``, which on Windows says the same word about `curl` and
about a debugger — and for every kind it is also the commands in ``provides``. A cell short of
something its siblings have is a defect unless it says otherwise.

*Within one artifact*, nothing may match what the second half of the rule throws out — debug
symbols, import and static libraries, headers, manual pages, documentation, test suites — unless the
artifact declares it, with the reason.

**The two exemptions are deliberately different kinds of thing.** ``lacks`` and ``keeps`` are
written by the recipe into the artifact, so the reason travels with the archive and a reader holding
it can see what was decided and why; that is what makes "no more than is needed" a list somebody
wrote down rather than a habit somebody remembers. `php_parity` is written *here* instead, because
what Windows has never built is a fact about the whole PHP row and not about one cell — and a fact
stated eleven times is a fact that will be true ten times.

What this cannot do is notice a feature missing from all six cells at once. That is
`php_parity.check` and the smoke tests, which know what a version owes; this knows only what its
siblings have.

Run where every artifact of a version is visible at once, which is ``publish-index.yml`` and nowhere
else: `gather.py` downloads one version's cells together, runs this on them, and deletes them. A
version the published index already describes is not looked at again unless the workflow is asked
to `recheck` it. An empty cell is not a failure — a target upstream never built exits 75 in its own
workflow — so nothing here asks how many cells a row should have.

Python 3 stdlib only, and it has to keep running on the 3.12 the index workflow installs: no
``tarfile`` zstd, hence ``tar``.
