"""What every borrowed runtime does identically, in one place so three recipes cannot drift.

A borrowed runtime is a download, a hash check, a repack and a proof — and the first three of those
are the same work whether the publisher is nodejs.org, python-build-standalone or RubyInstaller. The
fourth is not, and deliberately stays in each recipe: what it means for a Node to be usable and what
it means for a Ruby to be usable are different claims, and the whole of T27a's sharpest finding is
that *a check two producers implement separately will drift, and the drift is invisible exactly
because they agree on the field name*. So the mechanics are shared and the claims are not.

Nothing here knows what a runtime is. It knows about archives, hashes, targets and a ``PATH``.

Python 3 stdlib only, by policy: this runs on a GitHub runner with nothing installed.

    ``upstream.added`` and ``upstream.removed`` are what keep the word *borrowed* checkable: a reader
    holding this artifact and the publisher's own archive should find every difference between them
    named here, rather than deducing it from two hashes that do not match. A recipe that quietly
    deletes something is a recipe whose artifact cannot be told apart from a corrupted download.

    **Checked rather than trusted, because the fields are a claim and a claim can be stale.** Every
    path in *added* has to exist in the tree, every path in *removed* has to be gone from it, and a
    recipe that says otherwise fails the pack. That is not hypothetical carefulness: MariaDB shipped
    a pattern excluding ``mysql_ldb`` for four rounds while the file stayed in every artifact,
    because deleting its target first had made the symlink invisible to ``Path.exists``. A
    declaration nothing verifies decays into a comment.

    Paths are POSIX-relative to the root of the tree, sorted and de-duplicated here so that six cells
    of one version can be compared field to field rather than read side by side.

    *keeps* is the third claim and the only one that is **not** about the publisher, which is why it
    is written at the top level of the manifest rather than under ``upstream``: nothing was borrowed,
    added or removed, and the difference being declared is from *this repository's own rule*. The
    second half of that rule throws out headers, import libraries, manual pages and test suites, and
    a recipe that keeps one of them anyway has to say which and why — a mapping rather than a list,
    because a check that reads a bare path can only report "declared", and the whole point is that
    the reason travels with the artifact instead of living in a commit message. CPython is the first
    row that needs it: ``pip install`` of a source distribution compiles a C extension on the user's
    machine, and it compiles it against ``include/`` and links it against ``libs/python3XX.lib``.

    *changed* is the fourth kind of difference and the one this function was written without, because
    for three tasks there was no such thing: a recipe added files, deleted files, or left them alone.
    CPython's symbol tables are the first case of a file that ships **and is not the file upstream
    published** — same path, same purpose, different bytes — and that is exactly the difference a
    reader comparing the two archives is least able to explain, since it looks like corruption and
    nothing else here would name it. The value is the command that made it, not an argument for it:
    somebody holding both archives wants to know what was done to the file, and the reasoning lives
    where all the other reasoning lives.

    "An artifact contains what it takes to run, nothing else" is the second half of
    docs/one-version-means-one-thing.md, and until this function it was a sentence eleven recipes
    each kept or did not keep on their own. What that cost is measurable in the published archive:
    `redis 8.8.1` for Linux is **21.2 MB of DWARF in a 28.9 MB tree**, `nginx 1.31.3` 5.9 of 16.6,
    `memcached 1.6.45` 1.3 of 1.7, and MySQL 9.7.1 would have shipped a 609 MB Linux artifact beside
    a 109 MB macOS one. None of those is a recipe that decided to keep its symbols; each is a recipe
    where nobody thought about it, which is exactly the difference a rule with no check cannot tell.

    Placed here rather than in a checker that runs later because this is the last moment the *tree*
    exists — `parity.py` sees archives on one disk and can compare their sizes, and a size is a
    symptom. `strip.debug_sections` asks the question itself, of the file, for nothing.

    There is no exemption argument and no threshold, which is the point: a recipe that wants this
    tree published calls `strip.debug` and ships the smaller one. If a package ever genuinely needs
    its DWARF, that is a `keeps` entry and a reason written into the artifact, and this refusal is
    what would make somebody write it.
