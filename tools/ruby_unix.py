"""Build Ruby from source for macOS and Linux, and pack it as a relocatable artifact.

This is the last cell in `MixEngine's runtime table`_ that nothing can be borrowed for, and the
counterpart of ``php_legacy_unix.py`` on the other side of the table. Windows is free — RubyInstaller
publishes relocatable ``.7z`` archives for both architectures and ``ruby.py`` repacks them — and the
three relocatable Ruby distributions that exist for these two systems were each checked and each
refused: Homebrew's ``portable-ruby`` publishes exactly one version, ``ruby/ruby-builder``'s own
README says its artifacts "cannot be moved around", and RVM's are prefix-bound and years stale.

Unlike the PHP 7 range this is a **standing commitment**: those six branches are final, and Ruby is
not. Every security release of a line MixEngine offers has to come back through here.

Four decisions carry the weight.

*``--enable-load-relative``, which is the flag this whole cell turns on.* It makes Ruby compute its
standard library, its architecture directory and its gem home from the executable's own path at
every start instead of from the prefix it was configured with — and it makes ``rbinstall`` write
``bin/gem`` and friends as a ``/bin/sh`` preamble that re-executes ``$bindir/ruby -x`` on itself
rather than as a script with an absolute ``#!``. RubyInstaller is the proof it works, because it is
what RubyInstaller does. :func:`relative_shebangs` checks the second half rather than trusting it.

*The trust store, which was this task's open question and is answered in OpenSSL rather than in
Ruby.* A Ruby linked against a distribution's OpenSSL inherits that distribution's ``OPENSSLDIR`` —
``/etc/pki/tls`` on the Red Hat family, ``/etc/ssl`` on the Debian one — so an artifact built on
AlmaLinux verifies certificates perfectly on the runner and fails every handshake on a Debian user's
machine, with an error that names nothing. Setting ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` from Ruby would only cover the
programs that read it, and would leave ``OpenSSL::X509::DEFAULT_CERT_FILE`` pointing at a path that
does not exist. So OpenSSL is compiled here and :func:`relative_cert_defaults` teaches its four
default-path functions to answer relative to *the loaded libcrypto's own location*, which is the
same trick as ``--enable-load-relative`` applied one library down. What comes out is what
RubyInstaller has on Windows: a CA bundle inside the tree that the constant itself names.

*Everything outside the C runtime is bundled.* ``relocate.py`` copies each library in beside the
binary, rewrites every reference to ``$ORIGIN``/``@loader_path``, re-signs each Mach-O ad-hoc, and
then proves it from a directory the build has never seen.

*The build machine must not appear in what the build wrote down.* Ruby records the flags it was
configured with in ``rbconfig.rb``, and every native gem a user installs is compiled with them —
so a ``-I/tmp/mixengine-ruby-xyz/deps/include`` left in there is a path that will never exist again,
and an absolute ``CC`` is a compiler that will not either. :func:`scrub` and the bare ``CC``/``CXX``
in :func:`build_environment` are the two halves of that, and the smoke test compiles a native gem
from the moved tree rather than taking either on trust.

``docs/building-from-source.md`` is the other half of this file and was written before it, out of
the PHP pipeline. Everything in it applies here.

def relative_cert_defaults(source: Path) -> None:
    """Make this OpenSSL's default certificate paths relative to its own file, not to a prefix.

    ``OPENSSLDIR`` is fixed when OpenSSL is compiled, and everything downstream of it is a claim
    about the *build* machine: ``X509_get_default_cert_file`` answers ``/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem`` on
    the Red Hat family and ``/etc/ssl/cert.pem`` on the Debian one, and Ruby publishes whichever it
    got as ``OpenSSL::X509::DEFAULT_CERT_FILE``. Ship that to a user on the other family and every
    HTTPS request fails verification, with an error that names neither the file nor the reason.

    So the four path functions are taught to look beside themselves first. ``dladdr`` on a symbol
    in libcrypto answers with the path libcrypto was loaded from — ``<tree>/lib/libcrypto.so.3``,
    or ``<tree>/bin/ruby`` if it was ever linked statically — and two directories up from that is
    the root of the artifact, where this recipe puts ``ssl/cert.pem``. When that file is not there
    the compiled-in answer is returned unchanged, so an OpenSSL built by this and installed anywhere
    else behaves exactly as it always did. The environment variables are untouched: ``SSL_CERT_FILE``
    still wins over both, which is how a user points this Ruby at a corporate CA.

    The file is *edited* rather than replaced. Replacing it would silently drop any function a later
    OpenSSL adds to it; substituting four return statements and requiring all four to have matched
    fails loudly instead, which is the behaviour worth having in a file nobody will look at again
    until it breaks.

    Two details are borrowed from the file's own Windows branch, which solves the same problem from
    the other end — it reads ``OPENSSLDIR`` out of the registry at run time instead of trusting the
    one compiled in. Its once-only initialisation is OpenSSL's ``RUN_ONCE``, already included here,
    rather than anything this recipe brings; and the whole helper is compiled out on Windows, where

    """Take the debug information out of what this recipe compiled, and prove it took nothing else.

    **`borrowed` is what makes the first sentence true**, and its absence is what P5b shipped. This
    function took `relocate.machine_files(tree)`, which is every binary in the tree — including the
    ten libraries `relocate.bundle` had just copied in from the build machine. Those are the distro's
    own, and a distribution strips before it packages: the debug information lives in a separate
    `-debuginfo` package and there is nothing here to remove. The first CI run of this step said so
    twice in two lines — ``stripped lib/libcrypt.so.1 (2,101,249 -> 2,105,768, -4,519 of symbol
    table)``, a file that grew, and then ``strip --strip-all lib/libcrypto.so.3 changed 3 thing(s) a
    loader or a linker can see``. Nothing to gain, an already-packaged binary rewritten by BFD to get
    it, and a refusal to publish as the result.

    A library this recipe *built* is not borrowed even though `bundle` also copies it: OpenSSL,
    libyaml and libffi come out of `SOURCE_LIBRARIES` with their debug information intact and are
    exactly what this is for. The line between them is where the file came from, which is the same
    line `collect_licences` draws a few functions down and for a related reason — origin inside the
    work directory means this recipe made it.

    **This is the asymmetry P5a measured and did not fix**, and it is between the two halves of one
    row: RubyInstaller links with `-s` — visible in the `DLDFLAGS` its own `ruby-3.4.pc` publishes —
    so a Windows cell carries no DWARF at all, while these four ship 37.8 MB of it in a 106 MB Linux
    tree and 19.9 MB in an 81 MB macOS one. That is one version meaning two things, in the same
    direction and for the same reason as P4b's finding about CPython, and it is settled the same
    way: level down to the cell whose publisher already did this.

    Two calls rather than one, because this tree holds two kinds of file and *the instruction for
    one would destroy the other* — see :data:`strip.IMAGES` and :data:`strip.ARCHIVES`. `bin/ruby`
    and the compiled extension modules are loaded, and their symbol tables are dead weight.
    `lib/libruby*-static.a` is **linked against**, by anything embedding Ruby, which is precisely
    what P5a wrote into `keeps` — and `--strip-all` over it would produce a 7.9 MB file that
    resolves nothing and passes every test in this repository, because nothing in the tree links
    against it either. It gets `--strip-debug`, and :func:`strip.resolvable` checks the archive's
    index and every member's symbols across the operation.

    Done here rather than by configuring the build with `debugflags=`, which would be less work and
    a weaker claim. A flag that suppresses debug information is proven by nothing: the artifact is
    simply smaller, and whether it is otherwise the Ruby that Ruby's own build produces is a
    question nobody can answer afterwards. Removing the sections and then comparing everything a
    loader maps and everything a linker resolves is a claim a reader can check, on the same file, in
    either direction. macOS is smaller here than Linux for a reason `assemble` already gave: the
    `.dSYM` bundles are deleted there, which is where the compiler put each *executable's* debug
    information and is not where it put the archive's.

    """Exercise the build from a directory it has never seen, with its libraries beside it.

    Four claims, and the first two are the ones a build machine cannot make about itself.

    *Nothing in the tree reaches outside it.* `relocate.verify` re-resolves every dependency the way
    the loader will, from the moved copy.

    *It is this Ruby, self-contained, and it can verify a certificate chain.* That is
    :mod:`ruby_smoke`, shared with the Windows recipe so the two cannot drift into meaning different
    things by the same manifest field.

    *YJIT is there and turns on.* ``--enable-yjit`` without a Rust compiler is a warning, not an
    error, so an artifact can be published with a JIT that silently is not in it — and the only
    symptom is that somebody's Rails application is slow.

    *A native gem compiles against this tree after it has moved.* This is what makes ``rbconfig.rb``
    a claim rather than a record: it holds the compiler, the flags and the header directory every
    gem with a C extension is built with, and every one of them was written on a machine whose
    directories are gone. Compiling one here is the difference between believing :func:`scrub` and
    having asked.
