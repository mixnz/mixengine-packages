# here is to actually publish and `--dry` is the way to only generate and verify.

Run this after every successful release/build.sh. A new release does not enter the
index by itself, and the index is the only thing MixEngine reads.

Done. The signed index is at:

If you just added a whole new LINE rather than a new patch of an existing one, two
things are still outstanding — see "A new line" in release/README.md.
