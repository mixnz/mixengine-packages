# workflow's `release` input defaults to **false** — a run without it builds everything, uploads the
# artifacts for inspection and publishes nothing installable. And the input is not called the same
# thing on every workflow: php takes `branch`, mariadb, mysql and postgres take a comma-separated
# `versions`, the other ten take `version`.
